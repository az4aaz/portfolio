Propose optimized IT applications based on specific criteria such as execution time, accuracy, and resource consumption. Optimization involves a deep understanding of system performance and techniques to improve it.
- **Example: ["plue" Project](../../projects/plue)**
  - **Context**: "plue" is an artistic and poetic website integrating a 2D physics model and lighting calculations. This personal project aimed to explore creativity while implementing advanced computing and graphic rendering concepts.
  - **Technologies used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, P5.js
  - **Why it meets expectations**: This project demonstrates the ability to optimize web performance while handling complex calculations. Implementing a physics and lighting model highlights mastery of algorithms and rendering techniques, essential for developing high-performance and visually appealing applications.
