- **Example: Administration of Personal Servers and Software Chain Management at EXAIL**
  - **Context**: Administration of two personal servers (one under Slackware with an Intel x86 CPU architecture and one under Solaris with a Sparc CPU architecture) and management of various services for family and friends.
  - **Technologies and Hosts used**: Docker, Digital Ocean, Linode, OVH
  - **Why it meets expectations**: Server administration and hosted service management demonstrate the ability to handle complex environments and ensure service continuity. DevOps skills, acquired through managing the software chain from development to production, show a deep understanding of modern infrastructure management practices.
